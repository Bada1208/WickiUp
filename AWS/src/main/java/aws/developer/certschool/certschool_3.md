**_1. Which set of Amazon S3 features helps to prevent and recover from accidental data loss?_**
 
- Website hosting and Amazon S3 policies
- Object lifecycle and service access logging
- Access controls and server-side encryption
- **Object versioning and Multi-factor authentication**

https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/?nc1=h_ls

"AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your user name and password. 
With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password (the first factor—what they know),
 as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device (the second factor—what they have). 
Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources."

**_5. A photo-sharing service stores pictures in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and allows application sign-in using an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. Which AWS Security Token Service approach to temporary access should you use for the Amazon S3 operations?_**

- Cross-Account Access
- **Web Identity Federation**
- AWS Identity and Access Management roles
- SAML-based Identity Federation

"Web Identity Federation (WIF). This allows a developer to federate their application from Facebook, Google, or Amazon with their AWS account, allowing their end users to authenticate with one of these Identity Providers (IdP) and receive temporary AWS credentials.
 In combination with Policy Variables, WIF allows the developer to restrict end users’ access to a subset of AWS resources within their account."

**_6. You have an application running on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance, that uploads 5 GB video objects to Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3). 
Video uploads are taking longer than expected, resulting in poor application performance.
Which method will help improve performance of your application?_**
 
- Use Amazon Elastic Block Store Provisioned IOPs and use an Amazon EBS-optimized instance
- Enable enhanced networking
- Leveraging Amazon CloudFront, use the HTTP POST method to reduce latency.
- **Use Amazon S3 multipart upload**

"Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object’s data. 
You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts.
After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object.
In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation. 
It helps you to get improved throughput."

**_7. You are designing a web application that stores static assets in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.
You expect this bucket to immediately receive over 150 PUT requests per second. What should you do to ensure optimal performance?_**

- Use multi-part upload.
- **Add a random prefix to the key names.**
- Amazon S3 will automatically manage performance at this scale.
- Use a predictable naming scheme, such as sequential numbers or date time sequences, in the key names
 
"If you anticipate that your workload will consistently exceed 100 requests per second, you should avoid sequential key names. 
If you must use sequential numbers or date and time patterns in key names, add a random prefix to the key name.
The randomness of the prefix more evenly distributes key names across multiple index partitions. 
Examples of introducing randomness are provided later in this topic."

**_8. An application stores payroll information nightly in DynamoDB for a large number of employees across hundreds of offices.
Item attributes consist of individual name, office identifier, and cumulative daily hours. Managers run reports for ranges of names working in their office. 
One query is. “Return all Items in this office for names starting with A through E”.
Which table configuration will result in the lowest impact on provisioned throughput for this query?_**

- Configure a hash index on the office Identifier attribute and no range index
- Configure a hash index on the name attribute and no range index
- **Configure the table to have a range index on the name attribute, and a hash index on the office identifier**
- Configure the table to have a hash index on the name attribute, and a range index on the office identifier

"Hash Key allows you to uniquely identify a record from your table, and the Range Key can be optionally used to group and sort several records that are usually retrieved together.
Example: If you are defining an Aggregate to store Order Items, the Order Id could be your Hash Key, and the OrderItemId the Range Key.
Whenever you would like to search the Order Items from a particular Order, you just query by the Hash Key (Order Id), and you will get all your order items."

**_9. You are building an automated transcription service in which Amazon EC2 worker instances process an uploaded audio file and generate a text file. 
You must store both of these files in the same durable storage until the text file is retrieved. 
You do not know what the storage capacity requirements are. Which storage option is both cost-efficient and scalable?_**

- Multiple instance stores
- Multiple Amazon EBS volume with snapshots
- Single Amazon Glacier vault
- **Single Amazon S3 bucket**

"Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It’s a simple storage service that offers software developers a highly-scalable, reliable, and low-latency data storage infrastructure at very low costs."

**_10. You need to pass a custom script to new Amazon Linux instances created in your Auto Scaling group. Which feature allows you to accomplish this?_**

- **User data**
- EC2Config service
- IAM roles
- AWS Config

"You can access the user data that you supplied when launching your instance. For example, you can specify parameters for configuring your instance, or attach a simple script. 
You can also use this data to build more generic AMIs that can be modified by configuration files supplied at launch time. 
For example, if you run web servers for various small businesses, they can all use the same AMI and retrieve their content from the Amazon S3 bucket you specify in the user data at launch. 
To add a new customer at any time, simply create a bucket for the customer, add their content, and launch your AMI. 
If you launch more than one instance at the same time, the user data is available to all instances in that reservation."
